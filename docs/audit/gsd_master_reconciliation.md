# GSD Master Instruction Reconciliation Report

## Executive Summary
This audit reconciles the current implementation of IntelliHire against the `intellihire_instructions_by_GSD.md` master specification to determine the next priority gaps for the continuous enhancement loop.

| 6 | M01 Resume Intelligence | **Complete** | Pyodide extraction, PII redaction, multi-pass analysis, async cron jobs. |
| 7 | M01 Global ATS Resume Generation | **Complete** | Implemented in Iteration 1 via `/api/resume/:id/export?type=global` and `docx` generation. |
| 8 | M01 Job-Tailored ATS Resume Generation | **Complete** | Implemented in Iteration 1 via `/api/resume/:id/export?type=tailored` tailored to JD. |
| 9 | M01 Job Description Intelligence | **Complete** | Semantic JD extraction and matching active. |
| 10 | M01 Matching / Gap Analysis | **Complete** | Gap analysis matrix and ATS score calculation implemented. |
| 11-12 | M02 Competency & Adaptive Assessment | **Complete** | Adaptive engine, blueprinting, and evaluation logic implemented in `AssessmentV2.tsx` and `[[route]].ts`. |
| 13 | M02 Explanation/Teaching Engine | **Complete** | Implemented in Iteration 2 via `evaluateAndTeach` (Why-chain, How-chain, Misconception remediation, follow-ups). |
| 14 | M02 Interview Preparation Engine | **Complete** | Implemented in Iteration 3 via `/api/m2/prep/*`, `InterviewPrep.tsx`, question dynamics, and DOCX prep guide export. |
| 15 | M03 Simulation Framework | **Complete** | Implemented in Iteration 4 via `/api/m3/simulations/*`, `Module3Simulation.tsx`, dynamic constraint shifts, multi-dimensional rubrics, and M02 feedback loop. |
| 16 | M04 Interaction / Interview Simulation & Enterprise Protocols | **Complete** | Implemented in Iteration 4 via `/api/m4/interviews/*`, `Module4Interviews.tsx`, multi-panel coordination, anchored rubrics, candidate dossier ingestion (M01-M03), independent human rating isolation, and post-session M05 evidence synthesis. |
| 17 | M05 Readiness & Evidence Synthesis / Decision Support | **Complete** | Implemented in Iteration 5 via `/api/m5/*`, `Module5Analytics.tsx`, 5-layer auditable evidence ledger, multi-dimensional Bayesian readiness calibration, transparent decision matrix, human committee review records, EEOC 4/5ths adverse impact governance, and closed-loop remediation pathways. |
| 18 | Training Curriculum & Learning Pathway Engine | **GAP / Next Priority** | Automated personalized learning curriculum and skill remediation compiler consuming diagnosed gaps and misconceptions from M01–M05. |
| 19-21 | Institutional Cohort Intelligence & Enterprise Placement | **Planned** | Placement matching, accreditation reporting, and enterprise credentialing. |

## Immediate Next Step (Iteration 6)
**Plan:** Implement **Training Curriculum & Learning Pathway Engine** (Priority 18).
1. Design automated personalized curriculum generation bridging diagnosed competencies, misconceptions, and practical simulation gaps.
2. Structure micro-learning modules, hands-on lab exercises, and reassessment checkpoints feeding directly back into M02/M03.
3. Integrate learning pathways with the M05 Action Remediation loop.
